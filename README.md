# IoT Protocol Comparison

This tool compares encoding sizes for popular IoT data encodings.

Please extend with pull requests!

_Note:_ This is built with Go 1.5 Beta, and uses the Go Vendor
Experiment. It uses Glide's go15 branch to handle dependencies.

## Current encodings:

- JSON
- ASN.1
- CBOR

Would like to add...

- BSON
- Gob
- Thrift
- AVRO
- Protobuf
